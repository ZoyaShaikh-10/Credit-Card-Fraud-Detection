# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
In this machine learning project, we solve the problem of detecting credit card fraud transactions using machine numpy, scikit learn, and few other python libraries. We overcome the problem by creating a binary classifier and experimenting with various machine learning techniques to see which fits better. Also, handling Imbalanced issues using SMOTE techniques.
